# read-this

Weekend project: A curl-app - something like wttr.in - but for news!

Why would you ever leave your comfy terminal if you could easily
curl in the best parts of the internet right there?

Who needs fancy formatting, or style?

Rhetorical questions, what about those?

Think of ```read-this``` it as slow, clunky, rss-ish terminal feeder-reader 

For me, by me!
